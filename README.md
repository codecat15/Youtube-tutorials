# YouTube Tutorials – Demo Code Repository

Welcome to the official demo code repository for my [CodeCat15 YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@codecat15).  
This repository contains all the source code examples from the tutorials I’ve published so far.

Each folder in this repo corresponds to a tutorial topic covered on YouTube. I’ll continue adding more as new videos are released.

# 📌 Repository Structure

- Every folder represents a **single demo project**.
- The folder names are aligned with the tutorial topic for easy reference.
- Inside each folder you’ll find the full working code demonstrated in the video.

# Getting Started (No Extra Dependencies)

You don’t need to install anything special for this repository.  
Just clone or fork and browse the demo folders:

You can also click **Fork** on GitHub to keep your own copy and experiment freely.

# 🎯 Purpose

This repository is a learning companion to my videos. It’s designed to help you:

- Connect video explanations to working, readable code.
- Understand not just what to write, but why we make certain choices.
- Experiment, break things safely, and learn by doing.

**Note:** These are educational demos, not production frameworks. They prioritize clarity over edge-case hardening.
